  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet
    language used for describing the presentation of
    a document written in a markup language.[1] Although
    most often used to set the visual style of web
    pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML,
    the language can be applied to any XML document,
    including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable
    to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with
    HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology
    used by most websites to create visually engaging
    webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and
    user interfaces for many mobile applications.
    CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of
    presentation and content, including aspects such as the
    layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
    content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
    in the specification of presentation characteristics,
    enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by
    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
    content.Separation of formatting and content makes it
    possible to present the same markup page in different
    styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
    in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display
    the web page differently depending on the screen size or
    viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style
    sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to
    override the one the author specified.
